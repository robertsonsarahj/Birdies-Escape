# Birdies-Escape

This is the project created through my Intro to Game Programming class called Birdie's Escape. The goal of the game is to make it through all of the 10 levels by collecting the keys in each level to unlock the subsequent level to help Birdie escape from the grasps of the dungeon!

How to Play:
Download this repo as a .zip file and open the application nested within it. You may have to go into your security preferneces to open the game, but I assure you this is not malware and is just a fun lil game I made :)

Controls:
Move Left: a/left arrow key
